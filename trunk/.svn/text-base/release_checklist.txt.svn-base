############ Step 0:  Test it. ############ 

Hehehehe.

############ Step 1:  Update code/CHANGELOG ############ 

# svn log code/changelog
this will get you the log on the changelog... you can usually figure out what rev the last release was.

# svn log -r LAST_RELEASE:HEAD code
this will get you all the changes on the code directory since the last release.  LAST_RELEASE should be the number you got above.

############ Step 2: Tag the new version! ############ 

# svn cp code tags/code/x.y
this will copy everything

############ Step 3: Make the release ############ 

# ./release_code x.y

Where x.y is the version you want.  this makes a .zip file which you should upload to sourceforge.  You should tag the file with 'Featured', 'Type-Software', and 'OpSys-All'.  You should also modify the previous release by removing the 'Featured' tag and adding the 'Obsolete' tag.
